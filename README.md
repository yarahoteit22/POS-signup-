# POS-signup-

In this individual assignment, I am tasked with the role of being an analyst for the CRM team. My main objective is to assist our salesforce in identifying customers with the highest likelihood of signing up for a POS (Point of Sale) system. We are currently preparing for a campaign with a limited yet exceptional offer, and it's crucial to consider that our salesforce operates within limited capacity. To facilitate this process, I have been provided with a data-set based on real data from actual SMEs (Small and Medium-sized Enterprises). The data-set has been anonymized and sanitized to ensure privacy. Within this data-set, I will find information related to several SMEs, including those that signed up for a POS within three months after their initial interaction. My primary task is to build a predictive model using this data, which will enable the salesforce to prioritize their commercial activities towards the most promising customers, ultimately maximizing the number of sales during the campaign period. The success of this endeavor hinges on my ability to effectively analyze the data, develop a robust model, and provide actionable insights to the salesforce for optimal decision-making.
